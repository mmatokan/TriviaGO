# TriviaGO

TriviaGo is a network quiz application that enables players to challenge other to a quiz game.

After a login or sign up, player is taken to his profile page. Profile page shows players current rank and playing statistics. Here, a player can create a new game or view current leaderboard. When creating a new game, player must choose at least one opponent and a question category. 
Categories, questions, and correct answers are fetched from jService, a set of trivia services. Invited player receives a push notification and can accept or decline an invitation. Once all invited players have responded, the game begins, and the countdown starts. Points are a function of number of correct points and the time remaining.
